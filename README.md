## Labelling recipies on scraped data

As Geoffrey Moore said:

> “Without big data, you are blind and deaf and in the middle of a freeway.”

We mainly agree with this statement and as main objectives of this project we set the following: 

- Work through full ETL process starting from extracting raw data from web, transforming it to meet analysis demand and loading it to perform labelling
- Get high accuracy on test 
- Attempt to aproach the problem with Pandas as well as Spark in order to scale the process if we have to deal with big data
- Deliever consitent and reusable Jupyter Notebook
